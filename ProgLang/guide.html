			<span class=title>Text to scratch compiler</title>
		</div>
		<div class=inb>
			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>Some scratch projects are technically possible, but require doing something that no-one would ever do by hand. This compiler aims to automate those hard parts and make creation of such projects actually viable. Also note that this compiler is not designed to make a fully working scratch projects. It is only intended to simplify creation of computational parts of the projects (parts that do math with data in variables and lists), while still requiring user to make the rest of the project in the scratch editor in the normal way.</p>
			<h2>General overview</h2>
			<p>Before usage, compiler needs to be provided with what to compile. It can be done in one of 2 ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>By providing access to directory with files directly, which is a recomended option, but it isn't supported in every browser.</li>
				<li><s>By importing a zip containing all of the files and directories</s></li>
			</ul>
			<p>After that, the "Compile" button should be clicked. The compiler will recursively go through all subdirectories and find files that end with <span class=box>.js</span> which it will later try to compile. It will also look for files called <span class=box>exportList.txt</span> and <span class=box><s>template.sb3</s></span>.</p>
			<p><s>The project that the compiler will generate will consist of what is in the <span class=box><s>template.sb3</s></span> combined with newly generated code.</s></p>
			<p><span class=box>exportList.txt</span> is used to describe which functions should be placed to which sprites. If specified function relies on some other un-specified functions, those will also be included automatically.</p>
			<h2>Language syntax</h2>
			<p>In most cases amount of spaces and placement of newlines doesn't matter.</p>
			<p><span class=box>//</span> can be used to mark the rest of the line as comment.<br>
			<span class=box>/*</span> can be used to start a multiline comment.<br>
			<span class=box>*/</span> can be used to end a multiline comment.</p>
			Each file starts in outer descriptions mode.
			<h3>Outer descriptions</h3>
			In this mode the following structures can be used:
			<p><span class=box>variable YourVariableNameHere;</span> is used to create a variable. Multiple variables can be created using a single keyword by using commas:<span class=box>variable Variable1, Variable2, Variable3;</span></p>
			<p><span class=box>list YourListNameHere;</span> is used to create a list. Multiple lists can be created using a single keyword by using commas:<span class=box>list List1, List2, List3;</span></p>
			<p><span class=box>listoffsets YourListNameHere YourListOffsetHere;</span> is used to define a step size for the list.</p>
			<p><span class=box>listoffsets YourListNameHere YourListOffsetHere {YourOffset1NameHere: YourOffset1ValueHere, YourOffset2NameHere: YourOffset2ValueHere};</span> is used to both define a step size for the list and named offsets.</p>
			<p><span class=box>const YourVariableNameHere = YourValueHere;</span> is used to define a constant. In this programming language constants syntaxically look like variables, but when compiled, their values get directly inserted in places where they are used. Multiple constants can be created using a single keyword by using commas. Also note that values of constants <b>defined here</b> can only consist of 1 token. Setting it's value to something like <span class=box>12+34</span> is invalid here, since that is 3 tokens.</p>
			<p><span class=box>namespace YourNamespaceNameHere {}</span> is used to define namespaces. It's content should be defined within figure brackets. This can be used to neatly keep similarly named things isolated from each other. To access something from the namespace use dot syntax: <span class=box>NameOfNamespaceTheThingIsIn.TheNameOfTheThing</span>. When things from some namespace try to refference things from the same namespace using dot syntax is optional, you can just use names directly. Also note that if something isn't found in the current namespace, the compiler will not recursively try searching it in more and more outer namespaces, it will just jump straigt to the global namespace and try to find it there. Also, if the same namespace is defined multiple times in different places, the content will be merged.</p>
			<p><span class=box>namespace YourNamespaceNameHere "ScratchPrefixHere" {}</span> is the same as before, but can be used to also set visual prefix to everything inside of it. It can be seen in the compiled scratch project.</p>
			<p><span class=box>function FunctionNameHere() {}</span> is used to define functions - the things that actually contain code. Inside of the round brackets the list of arguments separated by commas is defined. In figure brackets the actual code is defined.</p>
			<p><span class=box>inline function FunctionNameHere() {}</span> is used to define inline functions. They can also have arguments. They are like normal functions, but they get pasted into the place they are called from. Here they can be used for either stack blocks or reporter blocks.</p>
			<p>Here is an example code:</p>
			<textarea readonly class=code style="height: 400px;">
variable valueToAdd;
list TheFirstList, TheSecondList;
namespace Math {
	variable OUTPUT;

	inline function add(a, b) {
		a+b;
	}
	function addGlobal(a) {
		OUTPUT = a+valueToAdd;
	}
}

namespace Main {
	function whenFlagClicked() {
		valueToAdd = 7;
		Math.addGlobal(Math.add(4,5));
		PenStuff.resize(Math.OUTPUT);
		Main.PenStuff.resize(Math.OUTPUT);
	}
	namespace PenStuff {
		inline function resize(to) {
			Pen.setSize(to);
		}
	}
}
			</textarea>
			<p>Which compiles into:</p>

			<h3>Inner code</h3>
			<p>Inner code refers to anything within function definition and there is a lot to cover.</p>
			<p><span class=box>=</span> can be used to set variables or list elements to some value. What needs to be changed is on the left, where to take value from is on the right.</p>
			<p><span class=box>+=</span>, <span class=box>-=</span>, <span class=box>*=</span>, <span class=box>/=</span> can be used to modify values on the left in specified way.</p>
			<p><span class=box>+</span>, <span class=box>-</span>, <span class=box>*</span>, <span class=box>/</span>, <span class=box>%</span> can be used to perform mathematical operations. First value should be on the left and the second on the right. % is mod operator. If left value of <span class=box>-</span> is missing, 0 will automatically be inserted. <span class=box>*</span>, <span class=box>/</span>, <span class=box>%</span> have higher priority than <span class=box>+</span>, <span class=box>-</span></p>
			<p><span class=box>&gt;</span> comparathon if value on the left is greater than on the right.</p>
			<p><span class=box>&lt;</span> comparathon if value on the left is smaller than on the right.</p>
			<p><span class=box>==</span> comparathon if values on the left and right are equal.</p>
			<p><span class=box>&&</span> logical and for values on the left and right.</p>
			<p><span class=box>||</span> logical or for values on the left and right.</p>
			<p><span class=box>!</span> logical not for value on the right</p>
			<p><span class=box>()</span> taking things into brackets can be used for changing order of operations.</p>
			<p><span class=box>functionHere(argumentsHere)</span> can be used to call a function.</p>
			<p><span class=box>someNamespace.property</span> can be use to access properties of namespaces.</p>
			<p><span class=box>something</span> trying to read a value of the thing. This will first try to find it in local scope of the current block within the function, if not found, try to find in the namespace the function is in and then, if still not found, search in the global namespace. Names of things can't start with numbers.</p>
			<p><span class=box>"something"</span>, <span class=box>'something'</span> string of text.</p>
			<p><span class=box>1234.567</span> numbers are written directly.</p>
			<p><span class=box>list[item]</span> square brackets can be used to access specific element of the list.</p>
			<p><span class=box>list[item]#offsetName</span> this could be hard to explain, but code example may help. This:</p>
			<textarea readonly class=code style="height: 130px;">
list Vector3D;
listoffsets Vector3D 3 {x:1, y:2, z:3};

function printCoords(vec) {
	print(Vector3D[vec]#x);
	print(Vector3D[vec]#y);
	print(Vector3D[vec]#z);
}
			</textarea>
			<p>is just a cleaner way of writing this:</p>
			<textarea readonly class=code style="height: 120px;">
list Vector3D;

function printCoords(vec) {
	print(Vector3D[vec+1]);
	print(Vector3D[vec+2]);
	print(Vector3D[vec+3]);
}
			</textarea>
			<p><span class=box>list[item]#offsetAmount</span> same, but instead of using names, it has a numeric offset directly. At first glance it may seem useless, but in combination with some other features of this programming language it becomes really usefull.</p>
			<h3>Local things</h3>
			<p>There exists 4 types of local things defined by keywords: <span class=box>const</span>, <span class=box>let</span>, <span class=box>lst</span>, <span class=box>sal</span> (and a 5th type which is function arguments).
			<p>All 4 support defining multiple at once by separating with commas.</p>
			<p><span class=box>const name=value;</span> constants. Works the same as outside functions, except here they can handle multi-token expressions. Doing something like this is totally valid:</p>
			<textarea readonly class=code style="height: 100px;">
variable globVar;

function do() {
	const ten = 30 / 3, sqr = globVar * globVar;
	Pen.setSize(sqr, ten);
}
			</textarea>
			<p>And it will behave as if it was:</p>
			<textarea readonly class=code style="height: 90px;">
variable globVar;

function do() {
	Pen.setSize(globVar * globVar, 30 / 3);
}
			</textarea>
			<p>This is also where named <span class=box>#</span> and numeric <span class=box>#</span> become really useful:</p>
			<textarea readonly class=code style="height: 200px;">
list Vector3D;
listoffsets Vector3D 3 {x:1, y:2, z:3};
list Matrix3x3;
listoffsets Matrix3x3 9;

function mulMatByVec(mat, vec, vec2) {
	const m = Matrix3x3[mat]#1;
	const v = Vector3D[vec];
	const out = Vector3D[mat2];
	out#x = v#x * m#0 + v#y * m#1 + v#z * m#2;
	out#y = v#x * m#3 + v#y * m#4 + v#z * m#5;
	out#z = v#x * m#6 + v#y * m#7 + v#z * m#8;
}
			</textarea>
			<p>That code will compile into:</p>
			<div class=imgBox><img src=guide2.png></img></div>

			<p><span class=box>let name;</span> or <span class=box>let name=value;</span> local variables. When compiled, all of them get assigned name that starts with letter s followed by a number. For each function numbers start from 0 and for every local variable go up by 1. During linking stage, variable numbers get shifted up to avoid conflicts.</p>
			<p><span class=box>lst name;</span> local lists. Work exactly like local variables, except can't be assigned a value directly.</p>
			<p><span class=box>sal ListNameHere SalName;</span> is for statically allocated list positions. Interesting fact is that local variables can be workarounded through <span class=box>sal</span>. In fact in code <span class=box>let</span> and <span class=box>lst</span> are just extensions built on top of <span class=box>sal</span> system.</p>
			<p>Let's assume you store some structured data in list. Each element defined by you takes up a fixed amount of actual list elements. Some of your elements get created and deleted dynamically while program is running and that is simle to implement. However some of those your elements need to be temporarily used during computations. Dynamically allocating them, doing computation and deleting them seems too computationally expensive. A much better solution would be to just reserve some parts of list and just once hardcode what part of code can use what space in list reserved for it without conflicting with other parts of the code. However doing it manually is very tedious, and in large project is unfeasable. Sal does that automatically.</p>
			<p>The most common example of how it can be used is for vector, matrix and quaternion operations, where you would probably want to have "local variables" to temporarily store those during calculations and discard them after computation is done. So on example:</p>
			<textarea readonly class=code style="height: 200px;">
list Vector3D;
listoffsets Vector3D 3 {x:1, y:2, z:3};

function main(a, b, c, d, e, f, output) {
	sal Vector3 crossBC, crossEF, sumA, sumD;
	VectorCross(b, c, crossBC);
	VectorCross(e, f, crossEF);
	VectorAdd(a, crossBC, sumA);
	VectorAdd(d, crossEF, sumD);
	VectorSub(sumA, sumD, output);
}
			</textarea>
			<p>In this example list Vector3D has a step of 3. This means that sal will set crossBC = 0, crossEF = 3, sumA = 6, sumD = 9. If function "main" is called from somewhere else, and that somewhere else for example also has 2 sal of Vector3D, then sal here during linking process will get shifted into crossBC = 6, crossEF = 9, sumA = 12, sumD = 15. It will literally just insert those number into places where sal "variable" is refferenced.</p>
			<h3>Branching</h3>
			<p> By default those will only take 1 operation, but {} can be used for multiple operations. Like in most other languages</p>
			<p><span class=box>if(conditionHere) actionHere</span></p>
			<p><span class=box>if(conditionHere) action1Here else action2Here</span></p>
			<p><span class=box>forever actionHere</span></p>
			<p><span class=box>while(conditionHere) actionHere</span></p>
			<p><span class=box>until(conditionHere) actionHere</span></p>
			<p><span class=box>repeat(amountOfTimes) actionHere</span></p>
			<p><span class=box>for(variable; amountOfTimes) actionHere</span> uses scratch's hidden for each loop. In variable you can either reference one of the existing variables (using dot syntax it it is in other namespace), or you can start variable by <span class=box>let</span> and then it will be created and only accesible within the for loop. Outside that for loop, compiler might decided to reuse the same actual scratch variable for something else even within the same function.</p>
			<textarea readonly class=code style="height: 230px;">
namespace A {
	variable var1;
}
function forLoops() {
	let var2;
	for(A.var1; 10) {
		print(A.var1);
	}
	for(var2; 10) {
		print(var2);
	}
	for(let var3; 10) {
		print(var3);
	}
}
			</textarea>
			<h3>In function scoping</h3>
			<p><span class=box>{ }</span> creates a new scope for anything inside. <span class=box>const</span>, <span class=box>let</span>, <span class=box>lst</span>, <span class=box>sal</span> defined inside do not exist on the outside.</p>

			<h3>Automatic optimization</h3>
			<p><span class=box>+</span> and <span class=box>-</span> are reordered and constant values are preprocessed. If you write <span class=box>a+6-7+11</span>, the compiled sb3 will only have <span class=box>a+10</span>. If you write <span class=box>-a+b</span> the compiler will reorder it to <span class=box>b-a</span>.</p>

			<h3>Built-in functions</h3>
			<p><span class=box>YourListHere.push(value)</span> adds value to the list. Can have multiple arguments.</p>
			<p><span class=box>YourListHere.delete(index)</span> removes item from the list.</p>
			<p><span class=box>YourListHere.has(value)</span> checks if list contains a value.</p>
			<p><span class=box>YourListHere.indexOf(value)</span> finds an index of an element with a value.</p>
			<p><span class=box>YourListHere.insert(index, value)</span> inserts a value to the place where index is.</p>
			<p><span class=box>YourListHere.clear()</span> removes everything from the list.</p>

			<p><span class=box>Math.sin(value)</span>, <span class=box>Math.cos(value)</span>, <span class=box>Math.tan(value)</span>, <span class=box>Math.asin(value)</span>, <span class=box>Math.acos(value)</span>, <span class=box>Math.atan(value)</span>, <span class=box>Math.round(value)</span>, <span class=box>Math.floor(value)</span>, <span class=box>Math.ceil(value)</span>, <span class=box>Math.abs(value)</span>, <span class=box>Math.sqrt(value)</span></p>

			<p><span class=box>Pen.clear()</span>, <span class=box>Pen.down()</span>, <span class=box>Pen.up()</span>, <span class=box>Pen.setSize(size)</span>, <span class=box>Pen.moveTo(x, y)</span></p>

			<p>Naming function "whenFlagClicked" turns it into when flag clicked block when compiled instead of custom block definition.</p>

			<h2>exportList.txt syntax</h2>
			Each entry is written on a new line. Each line starts with the sprite name followed by a single space, followed by the dot separated path to the function. If line has more or less than 1 space, it will be skipped. Lines that start with # are also skipped. If line is <span class=box>#stop</span>, lines after it are not processed. If path points to <span class=box>*</span> inside of some namespace, it will recursively find and mark all functions inside that namespace.</p>
